     <h1>The story of Epic Games:</h1>
      <h3>
        Epic Games, Inc. is an American video game and software developer and
        publisher based in Cary, North Carolina. The company was founded by Tim
        Sweeney as Potomac Computer Systems in 1991, originally located in his
        parents' house in Potomac, Maryland. Following his first commercial
        video game release, ZZT (1991), the company became Epic MegaGames, Inc.
        in early 1992 and brought on Mark Rein, who is the company's vice
        president to date. Moving their headquarters to Cary in 1999, the
        studio's name was simplified to Epic Games.

        <h3>
          Epic Games develops the Unreal Engine, a commercially available game
          engine which also powers their internally developed video games, such
          as Fortnite and the Unreal, Gears of War and Infinity Blade series. In
          2014, Unreal Engine was named the "most successful videogame engine"
          by Guinness World Records.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Epic Games owns video game developers Chair Entertainment and Psyonix,
          as well as cloud-based software developer Cloudgine, and operates
          eponymous sub-studios in Seattle, England, Berlin, Yokohama and Seoul.
          While Sweeney remains the majority shareholder, Tencent acquired a
          48.4% outstanding stake, equating to 40% of total Epic, in the company
          in 2012, as part of an agreement aimed at moving Epic towards a games
          as a service model. Following the release of the popular Fortnite
          Battle Royale in 2017, the company gained additional investments that
          enabled to expand its Unreal Engine offerings, establish esport events
          around Fortnite, and launch the Epic Games Store. As of August 2020,
          the company has a US$17.3 billion equity valuation.
